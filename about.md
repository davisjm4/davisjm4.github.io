# About Me
I’m Davisjm4. I love dogs, traveling, and being outdoors.  
My dream is to become a Teacher because I want to inspire and guide the next generation.  
This career will also help me achieve the lifestyle I want in which I can work with students, continue learning, and enjoy time with family and travel.  

To become a Teacher, I need a bachelor’s degree in education and teaching certification.  
This class will help me achieve these goals by building my skills in problem-solving, teamwork, and technology.
