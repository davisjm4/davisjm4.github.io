# My Coding Notebook

## 8/28/25 Binary notes
### Binary Flippy-do/number system - use a third # to create subsections
| Power  | 2^7 | 2^6 | 2^5 | 2^4 | 2^3 | 2^2 | 2^1 | 2^0 | solution |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Value  | 128 |  64 |  32 |  16 |   8 |   4 |   2 |   1 | |
| Binary |  1  |  1  |  0  |  1  |  1  |  0  |  1  |  1  |= 219 |

another example of creating a table
|header|a|b|c|d|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|dividers in row 2, data in 3|-|-|-|-|
|and beyond|-|-|-|-|

 Use back 3 slashes (the symbol before 1 on the keyboard) to start and close a block area
  Add up the values to get the answer:
  ```
  100010 = 34
  10100011 = 163
  1111111 = 127
  11011011 = 219
  10101010 = 170
  01000101 = 69
  00000100 = 4
  00111011 =
  0100111 = 
```
### Additional markdown formatting tricks:
**Bold** → Bold  
*Italic* → Italic  
***Bold + Italic*** → Bold + Italic
---
`Use backticks to block single quotes`
---
Add the language after backticks to highlight syntax:
```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```
---
> Use arrow to create reminders/notes: Binary `1010` = Decimal 10
---
Ordered lists with numbers
1. Step one
2. Step two
   - Substep
---
Unordered lists with -, *, or +
* Note
* Next note
+ using plus
+ two
- and dashes
- again
---
Task lists
- [x] Completed problem 1
- [ ] Finish problem 2
- [ ] Review number systems
---
Links are added with brackets [title of link] followed by the link in (parenthesis): Ex. [Go to Google.com](google.com)
